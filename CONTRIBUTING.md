## Coding Guidelines

### Flutter/Dart Style

- Follow the [official Dart style guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style)
- Use `dart format` before committing
- Run `flutter analyze` to check for issues

### Code Quality

- **Write clear, self-documenting code**
- **Add comments for complex logic**
- **Keep functions small and focused**
- **Use meaningful variable names**
- **Follow DRY principle** (Don't Repeat Yourself)

### UI/UX Guidelines

- **Maintain consistent dark theme**
- **Ensure responsive design** (portrait & landscape)
- **Use provided color palette**
- **Add smooth animations** for transitions
- **Test on different screen sizes**

### Example Code Style

```dart
// Good ‚úÖ
class TimerProvider extends ChangeNotifier {
  Duration _duration = const Duration(minutes: 5);
  bool _isRunning = false;

  /// Starts the timer countdown
  void start() {
    if (!_isRunning) {
      _isRunning = true;
      _startTimer();
      notifyListeners();
    }
  }
}

// Bad ‚ùå
class TimerProvider extends ChangeNotifier{
  Duration d=Duration(minutes:5);
  bool r=false;
  
  void start(){
    if(!r){r=true;st();notifyListeners();}
  }
}
```

## Development Tips

### Hot Reload
Use `r` in terminal for hot reload during development:
```bash
flutter run
# Press 'r' to hot reload
# Press 'R' to hot restart
```

### Debugging
```dart
// Use debugPrint for logging
debugPrint('Timer started: ${_duration.inSeconds}s');

// Avoid print() in production code
```

### State Management
```dart
// Always call notifyListeners() after state changes
void updateColor(Color color) {
  _selectedColor = color;
  notifyListeners(); // Don't forget this!
}
```
